## About

A selection of examples using Kafka and Kafka Streams with Clojure.

Blog post here: https://perkss.github.io/#/clojure/KafkaClojure#text-body

## Prerequisites
Expected to be able to set up Zookeeper and Kafka Broker to run the examples. 

## Unit Test
Check out the unit tests for each file to see it in action without the need for running with Zookeeper and Kafka. (Intention to add in Docker file to make it easier)

## Examples
* Kafka Producer and Consumer in Clojure using Java interop.
* Kafka Streaming example to upper case of strings.
* Kafka Streaming testing example.
* Kafka Streaming join with two Streams (Left Join, Inner Join, Outer Join)
* Kafka Streaming join with KTABLE.
* Avro Kafka deserialization and serialization.
* More examples to come regularly watch this space ...
